This is a collection of ports for ruby versions removed
from the OpenBSD ports tree.  You can clone this
repository and move it to /usr/ports/mystuff/lang/ruby,
then you should be able to build these ports.

This ports are simplified versions of what was included
in OpenBSD.  No subpackages are used, and support for
gdbm, tk, and ri_docs has been dropped.

Other changes:

Ruby 1.8: Rubygems 1.8.24 has been integrated and the
          openssl extension is not built.
Ruby 1.9-2.3: The openssl extension from Ruby 2.4 has been
              backported to build with modern LibreSSL.
